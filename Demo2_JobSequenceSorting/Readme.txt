Question : To order the jobs in logical orders

The Challenge
Imagine we have a list of jobs, each represented by a character. Because certain jobs must be done before others, a job may have a dependency on another job. For example, a may depend on b, meaning the final sequence of jobs should place b before a. If a has no dependency, the position of a in the final sequence does not matter.
Given you’re passed an empty string (no jobs), the result should be an empty sequence.
Given the following job structure:
  a =>
The result should be a sequence consisting of a single job a.
Given the following job structure:
  a =>  b =>  c =>
The result should be a sequence containing all three jobs abc in no significant order.
Given the following job structure:
  a =>  b => c  c =>
The result should be a sequence that positions c before b, containing all three jobs abc.
Given the following job structure:
  a =>  b => c  c => f  d => a  e => b  f =>
The result should be a sequence that positions f before c, c before b, b before e and a before d containing all six jobs abcdef.
Given the following job structure:
  a =>  b =>  c => c
The result should be an error stating that jobs can’t depend on themselves.
Given the following job structure:
a => b => c c => f d => a e => f => b
The result should be an error stating that jobs can’t have circular dependencies.




Answer : 

My logic is to find the connected jobs ( means only dependent jobs and deal it).
Non dependent jobs can be placed any order, may be as it is.

Assumption : 
 Job length is single character : a,b,c
 job separator for dependent jobs is also single character : '>'
 My valid inputs are  : "a"
						"x>y"
					
					If we need to use any separators like "=>" in the question, 
					we can do it just matter of changing the length of the input job and split character
